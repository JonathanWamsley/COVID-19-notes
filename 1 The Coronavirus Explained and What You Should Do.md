# Notes on the video

- In december 2019, Chinese authorites notified the world that a virus was spreading
- In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days

### Its Name

- Virus is called: The severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2
- Virus causes the disease: Covid-19, which ppl call corona virus

### What is a virus

- a virus is a hull around genetic material and a few proteins
- arguably not even a living thing
- it can only make more of itself by entering a living cell

### How corona spreads
- corona spreads via surfaces, but it is uncertain how long it can survive on them
- it spreads by droplet infection when people cough
- if you touch someone who is ill and then your face

### How corona spreads into the body

- starts through ingesting through the mouth, nose or eyes
- its destination where it can have the most dramatic effect are:
    1. intestines
    2. spleen
    3. lungs

### The lungs

- the lungs are lined with billions of **Epithelial cells**
    - Epithelial cells are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa
- corona connects to a specific receptor(ACE2) on the cells membranes to inject its genetic material
    - (research is being done on anti-ACE-2 antibodies as a possible therapy to block SARS-CoV-2 binding to the receptor) https://www.rndsystems.com/resources/articles/ace-2-sars-receptor-identified
- The infected cell executes the virus instructions to replicate
- the infected cell reaches a critical point of having too many virus cells and self-destructs
- the cell releases new virus particles infecting nearby cells
- this process allows the cells to grow exponentially (dealing with billions of cells)
- after 10 days, millions of body cells are infected and billions of viruses swarm the lungs

### Imune response
- the virus has not cause too much damage yet, but your immune system begins attacking infected cells
- the immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation
- immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, corona infects some of the immune cells causing confusion
- **Cytokines** proteins communicate to immune cells tell them what to do
    - your system over reacts sending way more immune cells
    - corona causes immune cells to overreact and mass murders 
    - two immune cells wreak havoc
        1. **Neutrophils**: great at killing stuff, including our cells
            - as they arrive in their thousands they pump out enzymes that destroy both good and infected cells
        2. **Killer T-cells**: order infected cells to commit controlled suicide
            - they are confused with this virus and start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too
    - the more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy tissue they kill
        - This can get so bad that it **can causes permanent irreversible damage**, that leads to scar tissue (**Fibrosis**)
    - in most cases, the immune system slowly regains control
        - kills infected cells
        - intercepts the virus trying to infect new ones
        - cleans up the battlefield

### Outcome

- majority of people infected by corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms
    - fever
    - dry cough
- some cases become server or critical (numbers are still uncertain)
- Corona is particilarly **dangerous for**:
    - people 60+ 
    - have preexisting conditions
    - weakend immune system
- in severe cases:
    - millions of epithelial cells have died
    - lungs protective lining is gone
- this means that the **alveoli** - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs
    - can be infected by bacteria that are not usually a big problem
    - patients can get pneumonia
    - respiration becomes hard or even fails
        - they need ventilators to survive
- the immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antivirals weapons
    - as bacteria infects, your immune system becomes overwhelmed
        - they overrun the body and enter the blood. (death is likely)
        
        
### The future outcomes of the pandemic 

##### Fast pandemic
- Fast: will be horrible and cost many lives
- worst case scenario: pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infections
- no counter measures are in place to slow it down
- in a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time
    - if the numbers get too large, health care system will become unable to handle it
        - the number of people infectected exceeds the capacity of the heathcare system
            - not enough resources are available to help everyone
            - people will die untreated
            - more healthcare workers get sick themselves, capacity of heal care capacity falls
        - horrible decisions about who gets to live and who doesn't will be made
        - deaths rise, trust declines, chaos abrupts 

##### Slow pandemic
- will not be remembered by the history books(I rather would say have less of an effect)
- to have a slow pandemic, all of us needs to do what we can
    - a pandemic is slowed down by the right responses ** especially in the early phase**
    - everyone that gets sick can get treatment since hospitals are not overwhelmed
    - **we must socially engineer our behavior to act like a social vaccine**
        - Must not get infected
        - Must not infect others
    - tactics to reduce spread of the virus:
        - wash your hands
            - soap destroyed the layer of fat(lipid envelope) the corona virus is encased in and leave it unable to infect you
        - social distancing
            - no hugging, handshakes, close contact
            - stay at home to protect those that need to be out to functions
                - doctors, police officers, cashiers all depend on you to not get sick
        - quarantines
            - travel restrictions
            - orders to stay home
            - They buy us time:
                - for researchers working on medication
                - vaccinations

#### If the pandemic starts fast with a steep slope, it is going to end badly
